### Read these notes carefully before proceeding 
 - Edit any mentions of @KimCheeSupport to your own support chat. 
 - We do not support forks, once you fork the bot and deploy the headache of bugs and support is your own, please do not come to our support chat asking technical help.
 - Your code must be open source and a link to your fork's repository must be there in the start reply of the bot.
 - If you come to our support chat on Telegram asking help about a "fork" or a technical issue with a module, you will end up getting ignored or banned. 
 - Lastly, if you are found to run this repo without the code being open sourced or the repository link not mentioned in the bot, we will push a gban for you in our network because of being in violation of the license, you are free to be a dick and not respect the open source code (we do not mind) but we will not be having you around our chats.
